# Brain Tumor Classification Using Machine Learning

This project focuses on classifying brain tumor images using machine learning techniques.  
The goal is to support early diagnosis by automatically detecting tumor types from medical imaging data.


## Motivation

Brain tumor diagnosis is a time-critical and complex task that heavily depends on expert analysis.  
This project aims to explore how machine learning models can assist medical professionals by providing fast and reliable tumor classification results.


## Technologies Used

- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook


## Dataset

- Medical brain tumor image dataset
- Data includes labeled tumor and non-tumor images
- Dataset was preprocessed before training (normalization, resizing, feature extraction)
- Dataset: https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/zwr4ntf94j/5
